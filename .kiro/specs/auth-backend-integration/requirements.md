# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on fixing the authentication integration between the frontend login/signup pages and the backend API to ensure users can successfully authenticate and access the study plan page. The current implementation has the basic structure in place but may have integration issues preventing proper authentication flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account through the signup page, so that I can access the study plan functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid registration data (email, username, password) THEN the system SHALL create a new user account in the backend database
2. WHEN user registration is successful THEN the system SHALL automatically log the user in and redirect them to the study plan page
3. WHEN a user tries to register with an existing email or username THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user submits invalid registration data THEN the system SHALL display specific validation error messages
5. IF the backend is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want to log in through the login page, so that I can access my study plan.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials (email and password) THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and redirect them to the study plan page
2. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
3. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL store authentication tokens securely in localStorage
4. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the access token using the refresh token
5. IF token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the login page

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want my login session to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to log in every time I visit the site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user closes and reopens their browser THEN the system SHALL automatically authenticate them if their tokens are still valid
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL check for existing authentication tokens and validate them with the backend
3. WHEN tokens are expired but refresh token is valid THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the access token
4. WHEN all tokens are invalid THEN the system SHALL clear stored tokens and require re-authentication

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to be able to log out, so that I can secure my account when using shared devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks logout THEN the system SHALL invalidate their session on the backend
2. WHEN logout is successful THEN the system SHALL clear all stored authentication tokens
3. WHEN logout is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the home page
4. WHEN logout fails THEN the system SHALL still clear local tokens and redirect to home page

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see appropriate loading states and error messages during authentication, so that I understand what's happening with my requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication requests are in progress THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display specific, user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate connectivity error messages
4. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL highlight the specific fields with errors
5. WHEN rate limiting is triggered THEN the system SHALL display the retry time information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an unauthenticated user, I want to be redirected to the login page when trying to access protected routes, so that I can authenticate and then access the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access the study plan page THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page
2. WHEN a user successfully logs in after being redirected THEN the system SHALL redirect them back to their originally requested page
3. WHEN authentication tokens expire during navigation THEN the system SHALL attempt token refresh before redirecting to login
4. WHEN token refresh fails during protected route access THEN the system SHALL redirect to login with the original route stored for later redirect
